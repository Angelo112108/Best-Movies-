<h1>The Best Movies According to John Angelo Estoy</h1>
    <h2>My top 10 Movies of all-time.</h2><hr/>
    <h3>Good Will Hunting</h3>
    <p>It must be heartbreaking to be able to appreciate true genius and yet fall just short of it yourself. A man can spend his entire life studying to be a mathematician–and yet watch helplessly while a high school dropout, a janitor, scribbles down the answers to questions the professor is baffled by.

It’s also heartbreaking when genius won’t recognize itself, and that’s the most baffling problem of all in “Good Will Hunting,” the smart, involving story of a working-class kid from Boston.

</p>
  <h3>Beautiful Boy</h3>  
  <p>Addiction is a tricky phenomenon to depict on screen because it’s such an insidious, internal disease. What often ends up happening is that we see the same sorts of manifestations of the damage it can cause, both to the abuser and to the people who love that person, resulting in cinematic clich&#233;s.

Director and co-writer Felix Van Groeningen mostly avoids those familiar horrors in “Beautiful Boy,” instead depicting one young man’s struggles with methamphetamine as a series of sun-dappled, time-hopping vignettes. His father’s efforts to pull him away from the brink—over and over again, with increasingly fruitless results—provides some semblance of a stable throughline.</p>
<h3>Just Go With It</h3>
<p>The people in this movie are dumber than a box of Tinkertoys. One fears they’re so unfortunate it’s not Politically Correct to laugh at them. That’s not a problem because “Just Go With It” is so rarely funny. Here is a story that began as a French farce. Then it was adapted into a Broadway play named “Cactus Flower.” Then the play was made into a movie. Now it has been made into another movie. This process has diluted it like a homeopathic medicine, so that not an atom of the original formula can be found.</p>
<h3>The Fault in Our Stars</h3>
<p>It should be agonizing, this tale of doomed love between cancer-stricken teens. It should be passionate, engrossing, suspenseful, something—even unabashed melodrama would have been appropriate, given the subject matter.

Instead, the film version of the best-selling novel “The Fault in Our Stars” feels emotionally inert, despite its many moments that are meant to put a lump in our throats. Perhaps it’s trying so hard to bludgeon us over the head and make us feel deeply that the result is numbing instead. There’s something just off about it for the vast majority of the time—an awkwardness to the staging, framing and pacing in director Josh Boone’s adaptation of author John Green’s tear-jerking, young adult phenomenon, and a need to spell everything out.</p>
<h3>About Time</h3>
<p>After seeing “About Time,” a time-travel fantasy that is basically “Groundhog Day” with Brit accents, a nice-bloke hero and minus a rodent (unless you count a rat of a boyfriend), I realize I have a problem.

I cannot help but fall for Richard Curtis’s rather self-indulgent romantic comedies. My level head might be crying ‘No,’ but my lopsided heart can’t help but say yes. For me, resistance is futile when it comes to his scripts for “The Tall Guy,” “Four Weddings and a Funeral,” “Notting Hill” and “Bridget Jones’ Diary” (which he co-wrote along with the unfortunate sequel that shall not be named).</p>
<h3>13 Going on 30</h3>
<p>Jennifer Garner  is indeed a charmer, but she’s the victim of a charmless treatment in “13 Going on 30,” another one of those body switch movies (think “Big,” “Vice Versa,” “Freaky Friday,” etc.) in which a child magically occupies an adult body. The director, Gary Winick, came out of Sundance with “Tadpole” (2003), a movie in which a 16-year-old boy was seduced by a 40-year-old woman, and some of us wondered how well that plot would have worked with a 16-year-old girl and a 40-year-old man. Now Winick finds out, by supplying a 13-year-old girl with a 30-year-old body and a boyfriend who’s a professional hockey star. Their big makeout scene goes wrong when she thinks he’s “gross,” and we fade to black, mercifully, before we find out what happens then. Can you be guilty of statutory rape caused by magical body-switching?</p>
<h3>The Greatest Showman</h3>
<p>“Without promotion, something terrible happens…nothing!” – attributed to Phineas Taylor Barnum

“The Greatest Showman,” directed with verve and panache by Michael Gracey, is an unabashed piece of pure entertainment, punctuated by 11 memorable songs composed by Oscar- and Tony-winning duo Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, who composed the songs for “La La Land,” as well as the current Broadway hit Dear Evan Hansen. The film is made for the whole family to enjoy, and so it leaves out many of the darker elements (explored in the 1980 Broadway musical Barnum, music by Cy Coleman). This is a difficult tightrope to walk, but credit is due to Gracey, a perfectly cast Hugh Jackman, and the entire cast, who play this story in the spirit in which it was written (by Jenny Bicks and Bill Condon). “The Greatest Showman” positions itself as a story celebrating diversity, and the importance of embracing all kinds. </p>
<h3>Him</h3>
<p>I can’t believe I left the house to see “HIM.” I can’t believe I took the train for over an hour from the north side of Chicago to downtown to see this movie. I can’t believe I stood in line to buy a soda and popcorn at the theater to see “HIM.” And I especially can’t believe that I sat through the entirety of this thematically lost movie, allowed it to live in my head on my trip back home, and that I’m currently sitting on my couch writing about it. Putrid and hollow, Justin Tipping’s brain-dead football horror film, which somehow managed to secure the backing of producer Jordan Peele, is incomprehensibly bad. </p>
<h3>How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days</h3>
<p>I am just about ready to write off movies in which people make bets about whether they will, or will not, fall in love. The premise is fundamentally unsound, since it subverts every love scene with a lying subtext. Characters are nice when they want to be mean, or mean when they want to be nice. The easiest thing at the movies is to sympathize with two people who are falling in love. The hardest thing is to sympathize with two people who are denying their feelings, misleading each other, and causing pain to a trusting heart. This is comedy only by dictionary definition. In life, it is unpleasant, and makes the audience sad.</p>
